# Water consumption survey
The personal project involves data collected by Prerak Trust (https://www.preraktrust.org/). I wanted to work with real world data that wasn't cleaned. This is a project to practice data analysis in R
The first part of the code is transferring the data into R along with removing any columns that were part of the data collection program but were not needed for the R analysis. There were some errors in the data collection (separate families from different wards were grouped together). 
I first made a box plot to check the median water consumption of each ward. From the box plot it seems as though wards 3 and 4 have a lower median water consumption than that of the other wards. If the organization were to look into this they could help wards 3 and 4 have access to more water or they could have programs for more responsible water consumption. Working towards a task like that would involve looking at water consumption in other villages. I did an ANOVA analysis to compare the difference between average water consumption in each ward. The analysis indicated that there was a statistical significant difference, to further investigate a TUKEY analysis was done. The TUKEY HSD indicated a significant difference in average water consumption between wards 3-1, 4-1, 6-1, 4-3, 6-3 and 6-4. 
I then created a scatter plot of water consumption in each ward while looking at the water source. A large number of people uses a private borewell. A bar graph was also made to get a better understanding of the water consumption of each ward and the source of water. It seems that the use of a provate borewell is not exclusive to any ward.
I next wanted to compare the water consumption between different family members. Looking at the data through this aspect could provide insight on who the organization could make workshops for when educating people on water consumption. I first checked to see if there was a difference the average water consumption between men and women. I expected women to have a higher average consumption due to cooking and cleaning dishes, roles that a traditionally filled by women in villages. The box plot showed that there is no difference. Next I wanted to see if different family members had a different average consumption. It seems that the family elders and the father consume more water. I difference is statistically significant with a p-value < 0.05.
